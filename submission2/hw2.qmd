 In this assignment, I wil be analyzing the HCRIS data to pull informtion from their reports and estimate ATEs. This is only a second submission, so the analysis and formatting of this file is still in progress. Also, I apologize for the lack of work in the document, there is more in the repository that I wasn't able to figure out how to add to the quarto file. We continue on!

The GitHub repository for this work is available [here](https://github.com/meganesmeralda/homework2). Enjoy!


\newpage
# Question 1
How many hospitals filed more than one report in the same year? Show your answer as a line graph of the number of hospitals over time.


```{r} 
#| echo: false

knitr::include_graphics("Q1.png")

```


\newpage
# Question 2
After removing/combining multiple reports, how many unique hospital IDs (Medicare provider numbers) exist in the data?

```{r}
#| include: false

knitr::include_graphics("Q2.png")
```


\newpage
# Question 3
What is the distribution of total charges (tot_charges in the data) in each year? Show your results with a “violin” plot, with charges on the y-axis and years on the x-axis. For a nice tutorial on violin plots, look at Violin Plots with ggplot2.


```{r} 
#| echo: false

knitr::include_graphics("Q3.png")

```

\newpage
# Question 4
What is the distribution of estimated prices in each year? Again present your results with a violin plot, and recall our formula for estimating prices from class. Be sure to do something about outliers and/or negative prices in the data.

```{r} 
#| echo: false

knitr::include_graphics("Q4.png")

```

\newpage
# Question 5
Calculate the average price among penalized versus non-penalized hospitals.



    Penalized Hospitals Mean Price:  9543.74
Non-Penalized Hospitals Mean Price:  9162.81



\newpage
# Question 6
Split hospitals into quartiles based on bed size. To do this, create 4 new indicator variables, where each variable is set to 1 if the hospital’s bed size falls into the relevant quartile. Provide a table of the average price among treated/control groups for each quartile.


\newpage
# Question 7
Find the average treatment effect using each of the following estimators, and present your results in a single table.


\newpage
# Question 8
With these different treatment effect estimators, are the results similar, identical, very different?


\newpage
# Question 9
Do you think you’ve estimated a causal effect of the penalty? Why or why not? (just a couple of sentences)


\newpage
# Question 10
Briefly describe your experience working with these data (just a few sentences). Tell me one thing you learned and one thing that really aggravated or surprised you.
